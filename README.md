**Neural Style Transfer** is a deep learning technique that merges the *content* of one image with the *style* of another, creating a new, aesthetically stylized image. This project uses TensorFlow and a pre-trained VGG19 network to perform style transfer directly on the user's machine without requiring a complex interface or GPU acceleration.

## üìå Project Overview

The project demonstrates how to blend the artistic style of one image (such as a painting) with the structure and content of another (a photograph). It is a hands-on implementation of one of the most famous deep learning applications in computer vision, perfect for artists, developers, and AI enthusiasts.

## ‚ú® Features

- üñºÔ∏è Blend content and style images using deep learning
- ‚ö° Run directly on your local machine (CPU supported)
- üéØ High-quality image generation
- üß† Utilizes powerful pre-trained VGG19 feature extraction

---

## üíª Platform & Environment

- **OS**: Windows 11  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code / Google Colab  
- **Python**: 3.10+  
- **TensorFlow**: 2.x

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Load the **content** and **style** images.
2. Extract deep features using **VGG19**.
3. Calculate **content and style losses**.
4. Optimize a copy of the content image to reduce both losses.
5. Save the resulting image.
